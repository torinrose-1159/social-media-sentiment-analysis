# Scraping Social Media for the Court of Public Opinion
I wanted to practice using Python and Playwright to scrape web data, and what better topic than social media? 
Utilizing a simple sentiment analyzing package (nltk), I started with the platform Bluesky to access with a personal account, 
allow an input of a keyword, and scrape all posts relating to the topic.

I then set up a PostgreSQL database on my machine to house this data to then access with a visualization software to present findings on keywords over time.
